Description: Implement cutting-edge binning techniques and calculate Weight of 
    Evidence ('WoE') for both numerical and categorical variables in predictive modeling tasks. 
    This package offers a comprehensive suite of binning algorithms, including
    entropy-based, chi-square, genetic algorithms, and dynamic programming approaches.
    Designed for credit scoring, risk assessment, and general machine learning 
    applications, 'OptimalBinningWoE' enhances feature predictive power while maintaining 
    interpretability. With automatic method selection, robust preprocessing, and support
    for monotonic binning, it streamlines the feature engineering process for data 
    scientists and analysts working on classification and regression problems.
