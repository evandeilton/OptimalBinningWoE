\description{
Performs optimal binning for numerical variables using equal-width intervals (Equal-Width Binning)
with subsequent merging and adjustment steps. This procedure aims to create an interpretable binning
strategy with good predictive power, taking into account monotonicity and minimum splits within the bins.
}
\details{
The algorithm consists of the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creation of equal-width pre-bins.
\item Assignment of data to these pre-bins.
\item Merging of rare bins (with few observations).
\item Calculation of initial WoE and IV.
\item Ensuring WoE monotonicity by merging non-monotonic bins.
\item Adjustment to ensure the maximum number of bins does not exceed max_bins.
\item Recalculating WoE and IV at the end.
}

This method aims to provide bins that balance interpretability, monotonicity, and predictive power, useful in risk modeling and credit scoring.
