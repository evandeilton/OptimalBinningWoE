\description{
This function performs optimal binning for numerical variables using the Optimal Binning for Non-Parametric Transformations (OBNP) approach. It creates optimal bins for a numerical feature based on its relationship with a binary target variable, maximizing the predictive power while respecting user-defined constraints and enforcing monotonicity.
}
\details{
The Optimal Binning for Non-Parametric Transformations (OBNP) algorithm for numerical variables works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Pre-bin the feature into max_n_prebins using quantiles.
\item Determine the monotonic trend (increasing or decreasing) based on the correlation between the feature and target.
\item Optimize bins by merging pre-bins, respecting the monotonicity constraint and other parameters.
\item Apply the bin_cutoff to merge bins with low frequency.
\item Ensure the number of bins is between min_bins and max_bins.
\item Compute Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) for each bin.
}

The algorithm aims to create bins that maximize the predictive power of the numerical variable while adhering to the specified constraints. It enforces monotonicity of WoE values, which is particularly useful for credit scoring and risk modeling applications.

Weight of Evidence (WoE) is calculated as:
\deqn{WoE = \ln(\frac{\text{Positive Rate}}{\text{Negative Rate}})}

Information Value (IV) is calculated as:
\deqn{IV = (\text{Positive Rate} - \text{Negative Rate}) \times WoE}

This implementation uses OpenMP for parallel processing when available, which can significantly speed up the computation for large datasets.
