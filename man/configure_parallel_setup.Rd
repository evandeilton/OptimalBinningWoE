\title{Configure Parallel Processing for Package Installation}
\usage{
configure_parallel_setup()
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{os}{Detected operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)}
\item{cores}{Number of cores to use for parallel processing}
\item{openmp_flags}{Compiler flags for OpenMP support}
}
\description{
This function detects the operating system and sets up the environment
for parallel processing during package installation. It determines the
number of cores to use based on the system's capabilities and sets
the appropriate compiler flags for OpenMP support.
}
\details{
The function performs the following tasks:
\enumerate{
\item Detects the operating system.
\item Determines the number of available cores, using a conservative approach.
\item Sets appropriate compiler flags for OpenMP based on the OS.
\item For macOS, checks if OpenMP is available and provides alternative flags.
}

This function is designed to be called silently during package installation,
typically within the .onLoad() function of the package.
}
\note{
The function is conservative in core allocation to avoid system overload.
It uses 50\% of available cores on systems with more than 2 cores.
