\title{Generates a Gains Table from the Weight of Evidence (WoE) and target feature data}
\usage{
OptimalBinningGainsTableFeature(feature_woe, target)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_woe}{Numeric vector representing the Weight of Evidence (WoE) values for each observation.}

\item{target}{Numeric vector representing the binary target variable, where 1 indicates a positive event (e.g., default) and 0 indicates a negative event (e.g., non-default).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the following columns for each unique WoE bin:
\itemize{
\item \code{bin}: The bin labels.
\item \code{count}: Total count of observations in each bin.
\item \code{pos}: Count of positive events in each bin.
\item \code{neg}: Count of negative events in each bin.
\item \code{woe}: Weight of Evidence (WoE) value for each bin.
\item \code{iv}: Information Value (IV) contribution for each bin.
\item \code{total_iv}: Total Information Value (IV) across all bins.
\item \code{cum_pos}: Cumulative count of positive events up to the current bin.
\item \code{cum_neg}: Cumulative count of negative events up to the current bin.
\item \code{pos_rate}: Rate of positive events in each bin.
\item \code{neg_rate}: Rate of negative events in each bin.
\item \code{pos_perc}: Percentage of positive events relative to the total positive events.
\item \code{neg_perc}: Percentage of negative events relative to the total negative events.
\item \code{count_perc}: Percentage of total observations in each bin.
\item \code{cum_count_perc}: Cumulative percentage of observations up to the current bin.
\item \code{cum_pos_perc}: Cumulative percentage of positive events up to the current bin.
\item \code{cum_neg_perc}: Cumulative percentage of negative events up to the current bin.
\item \code{cum_pos_perc_total}: Cumulative percentage of positive events relative to the total observations.
\item \code{cum_neg_perc_total}: Cumulative percentage of negative events relative to the total observations.
\item \code{odds_pos}: Odds of positive events in each bin.
\item \code{odds_ratio}: Odds ratio of positive events in the bin compared to the total population.
\item \code{lift}: Lift of the bin, calculated as the ratio of the positive rate in the bin to the overall positive rate.
\item \code{ks}: Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, measuring the difference between cumulative positive and negative percentages.
\item \code{gini_contribution}: Contribution to the Gini coefficient for each bin.

\description{
This function takes a numeric vector of Weight of Evidence (WoE) values and the corresponding binary target variable to generate a gains table. The table includes key metrics such as counts, event rates, cumulative sums, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, Information Value (IV), odds ratio, lift, and Gini contribution for each unique WoE bin.
}
\details{
The function assumes that both \code{feature_woe} and \code{target} have the same length. It groups the target values by the unique WoE values, computes various metrics for each group, and returns a comprehensive gains table.
