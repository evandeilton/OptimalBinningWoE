\usage{
OptimalBinningWoE(
  dt,
  target,
  feature = NULL,
  method = "auto",
  preprocess = TRUE,
  min_bins = 3,
  max_bins = 4,
  control = list(),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table containing the dataset.}

\item{target}{The name of the target variable (must be binary).}

\item{feature}{Optional. Name of a specific feature to process. If NULL, all features except the target will be processed.}

\item{method}{The binning method to use. Can be "auto" or a specific method name. See Details for more information.}

\item{preprocess}{Logical. Whether to preprocess the data before binning.}

\item{min_bins}{Minimum number of bins.}

\item{max_bins}{Maximum number of bins.}

\item{control}{A list of additional control parameters. See Details for more information.}

\item{positive}{Character string specifying which category should be considered as positive. Must be either "bad|1" or "good|1".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item woe_feature: The original dataset with added WoE columns
\item woe_woebins: Information about the bins created
\item prep_report: Preprocessing report for each feature
}
}
\description{
This function performs optimal binning and calculates Weight of Evidence (WoE) for multiple features.
It supports automatic method selection and data preprocessing.
}
\details{
Supported Algorithms:
The function supports various binning algorithms including CAIM, ChiMerge, MDLP, MIP, MOB, IV, PAVA, and Tree-based binning.
Each algorithm has its own strengths and may perform differently depending on the nature of the data.
The automatic method selection option tests applicable algorithms and chooses the one that produces the highest Information Value.

When specifying a method, use the short name (e.g., "caim", "chimerge") rather than the full algorithm name.

Control Parameters:
The control list can include parameters such as min_bads, pvalue_threshold, max_n_prebins, monotonicity_direction, lambda, min_bin_size, min_iv_gain, max_depth, num_miss_value, char_miss_value, outlier_method, outlier_process, iqr_k, zscore_threshold, and grubbs_alpha.
